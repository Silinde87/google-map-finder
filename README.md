# Google Map Finder by Pau RodrÃ­guez

## How it looks

ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://google-map-finder.vercel.app/)

With this React application you can find any direction from google map and set a marker on the map.

I have developed this application using atomic design and test driven development. All components have been tested with **unit tests** and the application has several **e2e tests** to corroborate its robustness.

I also make use of **github actions to run a pipeline** that automates the checking of the tests, and the different rules applied during the build.

The template [create-boilerplate-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-boilerplate-react), also developed by me, was used to start this project.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/Silinde87/google-map-finder.git
cd google-map-finder
yarn install

create .env.local file at root and set REACT_APP_API_KEY=google map api key

yarn start
```

## Available scripts in the application

### yarn install

> **Install app dependencies**

### yarn start

> **Runs the app** in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### yarn test

> **Launches the unit test runner** (Jest/RTL) in the interactive watch mode.

### yarn cy:open:local

> **Launches the e2e test runner** (Cypress) in interactive watch mode.

### yarn build

> **Generates a build version ready for deploy**.
